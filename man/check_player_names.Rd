\usage{
check_player_names(x, distance_threshold = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{datavolley: a datavolley object as returned by \code{dv_read}, or list of such objects}

\item{distance_threshold}{numeric: if two names differ by an amount less than this threshold, they will be returned as possible matches}
}
\value{
data.frame
}
\description{
Player names can sometimes be spelled incorrectly, particularly if there are character encoding issues. This can be a particular problem when combining data from multiple files. This function checks for similar names that might possibly be multiple variants on the same name.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  x <- dv_read(dv_example_file(), insert_technical_timeouts=FALSE)
