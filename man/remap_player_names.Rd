\title{Change player names}
\usage{
remap_player_names(x, remap)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{datavolley: a datavolley object as returned by \code{dv_read}, or list of such objects}

\item{remap}{data.frame: data.frame of strings with columns team, from, and to}
}
\value{
A datavolley object or list with corresponding player names changed
}
\description{
A player name can sometimes be spelled incorrectly, particularly if there are character encoding issues. This can be a particular problem when combining data from multiple files. A player matching the \code{team} and \code{from} name entries in a row in \code{remap} is renamed to the corresponding \code{to} value. Alternatively, \code{remap} can be provided with the columns \code{player_id} and \code{player_name}: all player name entries associated with a given \code{player_id} will be changed to the associated \code{player_name}.
